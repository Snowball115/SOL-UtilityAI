# Description
The Utility AI approach is a powerful method to represent complex AI in e.g. video games or simulations.
This was my first attempt to create one. 
Two teams fight against each other in a strategy game scenario. 
They mine resources to produce buildings and soldiers to eventually conquer key points on the map.
Once all the points are captured, the enemy can be attacked.
This project was created during the time at the university.

Unity version: 2019.3.0f6
